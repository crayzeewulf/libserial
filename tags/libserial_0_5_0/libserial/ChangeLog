	* src/SerialPort.h (class SerialPort): The constructor for the
	class is now "explicit" to make sure that a std::string does not
	get converted to a SerialPort object through implicit
	conversion. The destructor is not virtual anymore as this class is
	not designed to be polymorphic.

	* examples/write_port.cpp: An example for writing commands to
	the serial port was added.
	* src/SerialStream.h: Functions for adjusting the port's VTIME-
	and VMIN-parameter where added.
	* src/SerialStreamBuf.cc: Missing return statement was added.

	* src/SerialStreamBuf.cc: Interchanged "case 1" and "case 2" in
	SerialStreamBuf::SetNumOfStopBits() to make sure that stop bits
	are set correctly. This bug was pointed out by Olivier Chambard.
