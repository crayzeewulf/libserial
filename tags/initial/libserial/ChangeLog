	* src/GPIBController.h: Made the Prefix and Postfix routines const
	correct and also made the secondary address of the device an
	optional parameter.

	* SerialStream.C: The serial port can be used as any other stream
 	object through this class. The basic functionality seems to be
 	implemented correctly now. We need to test it with GPIBController
 	next.

	* Agilent4279A.h: The basic implementation of drivers for
	Agilent4279A is complete. The code seems to compile for now.

	* ReferenceCount.h: The ReferenceCount class is used by
	CountedPointer to keep track of the number of reference to a
	particular object. 

	* CountedPointer.h: Added the CountedPointer class to reduce the
	use of pointers in the package whenever possible. 

	* GPIBController.h: Reorganized the GPIBController interface
	so it is const-correct and uses references instead of
	pointers. Also reorganized the header file so that it looks like
	the standard template generated from the make-cpp-header script
	under emacs. 

	* configure.in: Added a line to generated doxygen.conf from
	doxygen.conf.in.

	* CVS: Entered the package into CVS repository. Removed all
	dependence on GNOME libraries. This package will be a standalone
	package while the GUI will be part of a separate package.
