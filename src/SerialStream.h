     * @brief SerialStream is a stream class for accessing serial ports on
     *        POSIX operating systems. A lot of the functionality of this class
     *        has been obtained by looking at the code of libserial package by
     *        Linas Vepstas, (linas@linas.org) and the excellent document on
     *        serial programming by Michael R. Sweet. This document can be
     *        found at
     *        <ahref="http://www.easysw.com/~mike/serial/serial.html">
     *        http://www.easysw.com/~mike/serial/serial.html</a>.
     *        The libserial package can be found at
     *        <ahref="http://www.linas.org/serial/">
     *        http://www.linas.org/serial/</a>.
     *        This class allows one to set various parameters of a serial
     *        port and then access it like a simple fstream. (In fact, that
     *        is exactly what it does!) It sets the parameters of the
     *        serial port by maintaining a file descriptor for the port and
     *        uses the basic_fstream functions for the IO. We have not
     *        implemented any file locking yet but it will be added soon.
     *
     *        Make sure you read the documentation of the standard fstream
     *        template before using this class because most of the
     *        functionality is inherited from fstream. Also, a lot of
     *        information about the various system calls used in the
     *        implementation can also be found in the Single Unix
     *        Specification (Version 2). A copy of this document can be
     *        obtained from <a href="http://www.UNIX-systems.org/">
     *        http://www.UNIX-systems.org/</a>. We will refer to this
     *        document as SUS-2.
