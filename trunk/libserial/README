libserial
------------------------------------------------------------

This library can be used to access the serial ports on POSIX
systems. You will need to following tools to compile this library: 

1. STLport: Libserial requires an STL implementation that complies
            with the C++ standard. We have been using the STLport
            implementation. It can be obtained from: 

		http://www.stlport.org/

	    Make sure that you specify the location of you STLport
            installation using the --with-stldir option when running
            configure.	

2. Doxygen: The class documentation for the library can be generated
            using the doxygen program. You can obtain it from: 

		http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html

	    Once you have installed doxygen, type "make dox" in the
	    top level directory and the documentation will be
	    generated under "doc/html". 

When you have installed the above tools, run the following commands:

------------------------------------------------------------
./configure --with-stldir=<YOUR STL LOCATION>
make
make dox
make install
------------------------------------------------------------

Note: The html documentation will not be installed by "make
install". I will fix this in the future release.	

This is a pre-alpha release. Things may not work as expected.
