libserial
------------------------------------------------------------

This library can be used to access the serial ports on POSIX
systems. You will need the latest gcc release (anything after gcc-3.2
should work) to compile libserial.

When you have installed the above tools, run the following commands:

------------------------------------------------------------
./configure 
make
make install
------------------------------------------------------------

Note: The html documentation will not be installed by "make
install". I will fix this in the future release.	

This is an alpha release. Things may not work as expected. 

Please send comments, suggestions, bugs to pagey@san.rr.com. 

Enjoy, 
Manish P. Pagey
